# What is Taekwondo?

Taekwondo is a Korean martial art that specialises in mobility, and is widely renowned for its fast and powerful combination kicks. Because of this, it is considered one of the best martial arts to train both general fitness and self-defence simultaneously. 

# What are the benefits of joining ICUTKD?

ICUTKD is the largest martial arts club at Imperial, an effect of training with elite level instructors, and a fantastic social atmosphere. We aim to make martial arts more accessible to the student community at Imperial, so keep our prices low – charging less than £1 per session! 
Whether it be for improving your fitness, learning self-defence, or even just meeting people with similar interests – come along! The first three sessions are free, so why not check us out?

# Does ICUTKD support WT or ITF?

There are two styles of taekwondo – WT- the style that is commonly associated with the Olympics, and the less well known ITF, which focuses more on the self-defence aspect. ICUTKD gladly supports practitioners from both styles.

# Does ICUTKD support beginners?

ICUTKD welcomes people from all backgrounds – our instructors will be sure to cater for all skill levels and interests.

# How is training structured (especially this year)?

We typically have 3 sessions a week, led by experienced instructors. Our main instructors are WT focused, but the content of the sessions mean that anyone can benefit from them.

Due to the complications from COVID, we will be hosting mostly online sessions led by our excellent instructors. These will focus on fitness + conditioning, kicking fundamentals, and stretching. These will inevitably improve your general fitness, but we also hope to make your experience at Imperial far more memorable!

We are hoping to include outdoor training sessions – please follow our Facebook page (Imperial College Taekwondo) and our Instagram account (@icutkd) for updates on this!

# Who are the instructors?

We have two main external instructors:
 
    • Our head coach, Chris Dancel, is a 2nd Dan Black belt in WT style taekwondo, as well as plenty of experience in other martial arts and self-defence systems.
    • Master Reza Saberi, a 5th Dan black belt in WT style, and a practicing member of the GB Taekwondo team. 

On top of this, we have many experienced student coaches, including Wim G (3rd Dan ITF), among others. Whatever your skill level/ affiliation, we have you covered!


# What are we doing for COVID?  

We are keeping our sessions online for now, but are aiming to get outdoor sessions sorted for up to 30 people at a time. Please note that the instability of the situation might change how we run things for at least this upcoming term! 
Please keep updated on our Facebook (Imperial College Taekwondo) and Instagram (@icutkd). 


# Does ICUTKD do socials?

We are proud to be one of the most social clubs at Imperial, with an active social schedule organised for at least every fortnight at every point in this term! We have held fantastic socials for the past few years, ranging from dinners, movie nights, ice skating, and even beach trips!

Again, with the uncertainty behind COVID, we have had to confine our socials to largely online this year, but will be holding frequent games nights and movie parties so that everyone feels involved.

The first social of the year will be run in the 2nd week, with an introductory games night and ‘speed dating’ social! Come along for a laugh and to meet up with people like you!


# When do sessions begin?

Our first session will be a Twitch livestream, on Wednesday 7th October, from 12.00-13.00pm. Come along to find out what sessions will be like, and for a live Q&A!

We will be holding 3 more taster sessions in the following week, and then begin the regular term training. 

# What is happening to competitions? 

We usually have 3 national level competitions in the BUCS university league, but these are liable to change. For now, the first one (Autumn term) has been cancelled, but the other two (Spring term) are still on – please watch our social media for constant updates!

This also applies to our international competitions (EUSA league + BUTL).

# What about our summer tour?

For context – we usually hold an annual, international summer tour, where we go to taekwondo clubs in different areas to train and embrace different cultures. Previous locations have included Singapore and Barcelona.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide too much info at the moment about our summer tour! We hope that the situation with COVID will change, but if it does not, we will try to arrange a national tour instead of keeping it international!
